# FBPP (File Based Player Prefs)

[![openupm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/com.richtools.filebasedplayerprefs?label=openupm&registry_uri=https://package.openupm.com)](https://openupm.com/packages/com.richtools.filebasedplayerprefs/)

### Overview

This Unity library is designed to replace the standard Unity PlayerPrefs. 

The main difference being that it saves all records in JSON format to a text file.

This makes it much easier to store your save game data in places like the Steam Cloud services, iCloud, Google Play or your own backend etc..

The Library also adds some functionality such as extra record types, encryption and more refined/flexible data access.

Keys are type specific, meaning that if you save a string under the key "key1" it will not be overridden when you save an int with the same key "key1";

#### Platform Support

Tested on Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS and Android.

Supports any Unity version that can load UPM packages. This generally means 2017.1+

## Installation

Install it via `Unity Package Manager`:
```
https://github.com/richardelms/FileBasedPlayerPrefs.git
```
## Initialisation

Before using any get or set methods you must initialise FBPP by calling FBPP.Start and passing your desired configuration settings like so:

```
// build your config
var config = new FBPPConfig()
{
    SaveFileName = "my-save-file.txt",
    AutoSaveData = false,
    ScrambleSaveData = true,
    EncryptionSecret = "my-secret",
    SaveFilePath = "my/explicit/savefile/path"
};
// pass it to FBPP
FBPP.Start(config);
```

All config values are optional. For example if you only want to set the encryption secret and turn off AutoSaveData then you would initialise like this:

```
var config = new FBPPConfig()
{
    AutoSaveData = false,
    EncryptionSecret = "my-secret"
};
FBPP.Start(config);
```
The default config values are as follows

```
AutoSaveData = true;

EncryptionSecret = "encryption-secret-default";

SaveFileName = "saveData.txt";

ScrambleSaveData = true;

SaveFilePath = Application.persistentDataPath;

```

#### !Please see the advanced usage section for more info regarding these config values! 

## Save File Encryption

I have added a very simple scrambler to the saved json so that players cannot easily cheat by changing the values in the saved game file, this can be enabled or disabled by initialising with custom settings. Please note, this is not super secure encryption, just a small string scrambler method that i think will stop 99.99% of users from editing the data.

If you choose a custom value for the Encryption secret and release a version of your software with it, you must stick with it or it will break all old save files that were created with the old value.

## API

### Get and Set
```
FBPP.SetString(string key, string value);

FBPP.GetString(string key, (optional)string defaultValue);
    
FBPP.SetInt(string key, int value);

FBPP.GetInt(string key, (optional)int defaultValue); 
    
FBPP.SetFloat(string key, float value);

FBPP.GetFloat(string key, (optional)float defaultValue); 
    
FBPP.SetBool(string key, bool value);

FBPP.GetBool(string key, (optional)bool defaultValue);
```
### Util Methods
```
FBPP.HasKey(String key); will return true if there is any data type saved under the requested key
    
FBPP.HasKeyForString(String key); will return true if there is a string saved under the requested key
    
FBPP.HasKeyForInt(String key); will return true if there is a int saved under the requested key
    
FBPP.HasKeyForFloat(String key); will return true if there is a float saved under the requested key
    
FBPP.HasKeyForBool(String key); will return true if there is a bool saved under the requested key
    
FBPP.DeleteKey(String key); This will delete ALL data records saved under the key regardless of type
    
FBPP.DeleteString(String key); This will delete any string recorded under the key
    
FBPP.DeleteInt(String key); This will delete any int recorded under the key
    
FBPP.DeleteFloat(String key); This will delete any float recorded under the key
    
FBPP.DeleteBool(String key); This will delete any bool recorded under the key

FBPP.DeleteAll(); // Deletes all records and replaces the save file with a blank one
    
```

## Advanced Usage 

### Optimisation 

Unfortunately, encrypting a text file is pretty slow, no matter how you do it, so if you are using one of the Set methods during active gameplay, you might notice some slowdown in fps.

To counteract this i have included some advanced features that give you more control over when and how the library saves/encrypts data.

If the config value AutoSaveData is set to true (the default setting), then every time a Set method is called, it will write and encrypt the save data immediately.

If set to false, then it will only save and encrypt the data to file when you call FBPP.Save();

This means that the save data is stored in memory until you specifically tell it to write the file. This means you can choose a better time to write all the data and not take any noticeable performance hits.

To save the data to disk, call the following method:

```
FBPP.Save();
```

### Error handling and data backups

If there is ever a situation where FBPP cannot load an existing save file (due to corruption), then by default, it will automatically create a new one. This is not ideal as your player will lose all their progress.

When this happens, FBPP will trigger an event that you can listen to, so that you can restore your backup file.

#### Creating a backup using FBPP.GetSaveFileAsJson();

By using FBPP.GetSaveFileAsJson(), you could make a physical backup of the save file data from time to time.

```
FBPP.GetSaveFileAsJson(); // returns the saved data as a json object in string format.
```

#### Restoring a backup

You should setup your error handling code when calling start like so:

```
// enter your custom settings
var config = new FBPPConfig()
{
    AutoSaveData = false,
    EncryptionSecret = "my-secret",
};

//Listen to the OnLoadErrorEvent
config.OnLoadError = ()=>
{
    // Grab your backup from where ever you saved it
    string myBackupJson = GetMyBackupJson();

    // Restore that backup
    FBPP.OverwriteLocalSaveFile(myBackupJson);
};

// Pass the config to FBPP
FBPP.Start(config);
```

## Attribution

You do not need to credit/attribute me or this lib in your game BUT please do let me know when your project is out, i'm always super happy to see what games are using it, maybe even send me a steam key if you are feeling generous ;)
